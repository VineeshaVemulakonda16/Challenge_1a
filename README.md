# Adobe India Hackathon 2025 – Round 1A

## Overview

This repository contains a complete solution for Challenge 1a of the Adobe India Hackathon 2025. The task is to extract a structured outline (headings) from PDF files and output corresponding .json files. The solution is fully containerized using Docker and optimized to meet performance and resource constraints.


##  What It Does

- Automatically processes all .pdf files from the input folder
- Extracts headings using heuristic rules:
  - All-uppercase lines
  - Title-case lines
  - Short lines (≤ 6 words and < 60 characters)
- Associates each heading with its page number
- Outputs a structured JSON file for each PDF
- Works completely offline inside a Docker container


## Project Structure
 ```
Challenge_1a/
├── sample_dataset/
│ ├── pdfs/                 # Input PDF files
│ ├── outputs/              # Output JSON files
│ └── schema/
│ └── output_schema.json
├── process_pdfs.py         # Main processing script
├── Dockerfile              # Docker configuration
└── README.md               # This file
 ```


## Approach

The script uses PyPDF2 to extract the document title from PDF metadata and parse each page to detect headings based on textual heuristics:

- Lines in ALL CAPS  
- Lines using title case  
- Lines with limited word count and length  

Every matched line is considered a level 1 heading for this baseline solution. All output follows the schema provided in the challenge.

## Docker Build and Execution

### Build the Docker image:
```
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t pdf-outline-extractor .
```

### Run the container:
```
docker run --rm `
  -v "${PWD}\sample_dataset\pdfs:/app/sample_dataset/pdfs:ro" `
  -v "${PWD}\sample_dataset\outputs:/app/sample_dataset/outputs" `
  --network none `
  pdf-outline-extractor
```

---

### Current Sample Solution
The provided process_pdfs.py is a basic sample that demonstrates:
- PDF file scanning from input directory
- Dummy JSON data generation
- Output file creation in the specified format

---

### Processing Script (process_pdfs.py)
python
```
# Current sample implementation
import os
import json
from PyPDF2 import PdfReader

def extract_headings_from_text(text):
    lines = text.split('\n')
    headings = []
    for line in lines:
        clean_line = line.strip()
        if clean_line and (
            clean_line.isupper() or
            (len(clean_line.split()) <= 6 and len(clean_line) < 60) or
            clean_line.istitle()
        ):
            headings.append(clean_line)
    return headings

def get_pdf_title(reader):
    title = reader.metadata.title
    return title if title else "Untitled PDF"

def main():
    input_folder = 'sample_dataset/pdfs'
    output_folder = 'sample_dataset/outputs'

    os.makedirs(output_folder, exist_ok=True)

    for filename in os.listdir(input_folder):
        if filename.endswith('.pdf'):
            pdf_path = os.path.join(input_folder, filename)

            try:
                reader = PdfReader(pdf_path)
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"⚠ Error reading {filename}: {e}")
                continue

            title = get_pdf_title(reader)
            outline = []

            for i, page in enumerate(reader.pages):
                try:
                    text = page.extract_text() or ""
                    headings = extract_headings_from_text(text)
                    for heading in headings:
                        outline.append({
                            "level": "1",
                            "text": heading,
                            "page": i + 1
                        })
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"⚠ Failed to read page {i+1} of {filename}: {e}")

            output_json = {
                "title": title,
                "outline": outline
            }

            output_path = os.path.join(output_folder, filename.replace('.pdf', '.json'))
            with open(output_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                json.dump(output_json, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)

            print(f" Done: {output_path}")

if _name_ == "_main_":
    main()

```

---
### Docker Configuration
Dockerfile
```
FROM python:3.10-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install PyPDF2 pycryptodome
CMD ["python", "process_pdfs.py"]

```

## Output Format

Each PDF generates a corresponding .json file stored in the sample_dataset/outputs/ directory:
```
json
{
  "title": "Document Title",
  "outline": [
    {
      "level": "1",
      "text": "Heading Text",
      "page": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

The output is schema-validated using sample_dataset/schema/output_schema.json.

---
## Constraint Qualification Summary

- The solution executes within 10 seconds for a 50-page PDF, ensuring fast runtime performance.
- It operates fully offline with no internet access required during execution.
- The Docker container runs in network-isolated mode using --network none.
- No external models are used; all dependencies are lightweight and stay well below the 200MB limit.
- The code runs entirely on CPU, and is fully compatible with AMD64 architecture.
- The output JSON strictly follows the provided schema (output_schema.json), ensuring valid structure and format.

---

## Conclusion


This solution is a lightweight, heuristic-based PDF outline extractor designed for speed, offline execution, and schema compliance. It lays a solid foundation for more advanced enhancements like font-based heading detection, multilingual support, and ML-driven analysis.
